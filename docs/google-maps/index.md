# @vue-deckgl-suite/google-maps

The `@vue-deckgl-suite/google-maps` package provides powerful Vue components to integrate **Google** maps with **Deck.gl** layers, enabling you to build high-performance interactive geospatial visualizations. These components simplify handling map and GoogleMapsOverlay for your applications, leveraging both **Deck.gl** and **Google** capabilities.

Developers using only the **`@vue-deckgl-suite/google-maps`** package can define Deck.gl layers as **ES6 class instances** and pass them to the `layers` prop of the `DeckGL` component. This is the default behavior and requires familiarity with the Deck.gl API.

## Available Components
