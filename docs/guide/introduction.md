# Introduction

The **`@vue-deckgl-suite`** monorepo is built to provide a seamless integration of **Deck.gl** and **Vue-based applications**, enabling the development of high-performance geospatial visualizations with ease. It consists of a series of modular packages that work together to support various basemaps and visualization use cases.

## Overview of Packages

### `@vue-deckgl-suite/maplibre`
This package provides two core components:
1. **`Map`**: A Vue wrapper for **MapLibre GL**, a powerful and customizable open-source basemap provider.
2. **`DeckGL`**: An overlay component that facilitates rendering of **Deck.gl** visualization layers on top of the MapLibre map.

Developers using only the **`@vue-deckgl-suite/maplibre`** package can define Deck.gl layers as **ES6 class instances** and pass them to the `layers` prop of the `DeckGL` component. This is the default behavior and requires familiarity with the Deck.gl API.

---

### `@vue-deckgl-suite/layers`
The **`@vue-deckgl-suite/layers`** package builds upon the `@vue-deckgl-suite/maplibre` package by introducing declarative support for creating Deck.gl layers using Vue components. This package allows developers to define Deck.gl layers as **Vue child components**, nested inside the `DeckGL` overlay. This declarative syntax streamlines development by aligning with Vue's component-based architecture.


## Usage Scenarios

Depending on the combination of packages used, you have two options for defining and rendering Deck.gl layers.

### 1. Using Only `@vue-deckgl-suite/maplibre`
In this case, you will use the **`DeckGL` component** as an overlay for MapLibre and provide all Deck.gl layers as **ES6 class instances** to the `layers` prop. Example:

```vue
<script setup>
import { DeckGL, Map } from '@vue-deckgl-suite/maplibre'
import { HeatmapLayer } from '@deck.gl/aggregation-layers'

const heatmapLayer = new HeatmapLayer({
  id: 'heatmap',
  data: 'data-url.json',
  getPosition: d => d.coordinates,
  getWeight: d => d.value,
})
</script>

<template>
  <DeckGL :layers="[heatmapLayer]">
    <Map
      center="[-122.4, 37.74]"
      :zoom="11"
      style="width: 100%; height: 100%;"
    />
  </DeckGL>
</template>
```

This approach ensures full flexibility for programmatically managing Deck.gl layers and is suitable when only using `@vue-deckgl-suite/maplibre`.


### 2. Using Both `@vue-deckgl-suite/maplibre` and `@vue-deckgl-suite/layers`
When both packages are used, you can utilize **declarative Vue syntax** to define Deck.gl layers as child components of the `DeckGL` overlay. Example:

```vue
<template>
  <DeckGL>
    <Map
      center="[-122.4, 37.74]"
      :zoom="11"
      style="width: 100%; height: 100%;"
    />
    <HeatmapLayer
      id="heatmap"
      data="data-url.json"
      :getPosition="d => d.coordinates"
      :getWeight="d => d.value"
    />
  </DeckGL>
</template>
```

With this approach, the **`@vue-deckgl-suite/layers`** package simplifies configuration by allowing each layer to be treated as a standalone Vue component. Props passed to each component map directly to Deck.gl class attributes.


## Why Choose `@vue-deckgl-suite`?

- **Modular Design**: Use the pieces you need for your projectâ€”choose between flexible ES6 instance-based configurations or Vue's declarative syntax.
- **Scalability**: Process and render large geospatial datasets using Deck.gl's WebGL-powered performance features.
- **Future-Proof**: The suite supports MapLibre as a basemap now, with plans to include Google Maps, Mapbox, and others in the future.
