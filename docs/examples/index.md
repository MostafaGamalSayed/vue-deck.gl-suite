# Available Examples by Layer

Explore the interactive examples below to learn how to use different layers in **@vue-deckgl-suite/layers** to build stunning geospatial visualizations.

## Layer Examples

- **[Arc Layer](/examples/arc-layer/):** Draws great arcs (curves) between two points on a map.
- **[GeoJson Layer (Paths)](/examples/geojson-layer-paths/):** Visualizes GeoJSON data with full feature support.
- **[Hexagon Layer](/examples/hexagon-layer/):** Aggregates scattered data points into hexagonal grids.
- **[Grid Layer](/examples/grid-layer/):** Organizes and visualizes points within rectangular grids.
- **[Column Layer](/examples/column-layer/):** Visualizes data as vertical cylinders, useful for 3D geospatial data
  representation.
- **[Path Layer](/examples/path-layer/):** Plots point-to-point paths or line segments on a map.
- **[Trips Layer](/examples/trips-layer/):** Animates trips or movement data over time.
- **[Icon Layer](/examples/icon-layer/):** Renders icons or images at specific geospatial positions.
- **[Point Cloud Layer](/examples/point-cloud-layer/):** Renders 3D point clouds, typically used for visualizing large
  sets of points in space.
- **[Polygon Layer](/examples/polygon-layer/):** Renders filled or stroked polygons, useful for visualizing areas,
   boundaries, or other polygon-based data.
- **[Contour Layer](/examples/contour-layer/):** Generates contour lines or filled contour regions, useful for visualizing
    elevation or density data.
- **[Scatterplot Layer](/examples/scatterplot-layer/):** Renders scatter points with options to customize size, color, and
  opacity for data visualization.
- **[WMS Layer](/examples/wms-layer/):** Displays map tiles from a Web Map Service endpoint.
- **[Bitmap Layer](/examples/bitmap-layer/):** Overlays a static image over specified bounds.
- **[Line Layer](/examples/line-layer/):** Renders straight line segments between coordinates.
- **[Solid Polygon Layer](/examples/solid-polygon-layer/):** Renders filled/extruded polygons.
- **[Grid Cell Layer](/examples/grid-cell-layer/):** Renders a grid of rectangular cells with elevation.
- **[Screen Grid Layer](/examples/screen-grid-layer/):** Aggregates points into screen-aligned grid cells.
- **[MVT Layer](/examples/mvt-layer/):** Renders vector tiles (Mapbox Vector Tile format).
- **[Terrain Layer](/examples/terrain-layer/):** Renders photorealistic terrain from elevation tiles.
- **[Text Layer](/examples/text-layer/):** Renders text labels at coordinates.
